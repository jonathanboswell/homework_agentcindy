I'm Cindy Ly, a Senior Revenue Analyst at a company based in Santa Monica. I have four years of experience in accounting in both corporate and revenue accounting. Although I graduated with a degree in Finance, I somehow ended up in accounting. I am currently looking to switch careers and discover what I am passionate about. I love playing video games and spectating esports on twitch as well as watching anime. I also enjoy rock climbing and going out with friends.
